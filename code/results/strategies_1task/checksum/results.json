This is similar to what we did in [Lab 3](/lab/labs/lab03), but instead of using a web framework such as Django, Flask or Ruby on Rails, we'll use the built-in HTTP server and a static file server.\n\nOur web server will serve up static files: images, CSS stylesheets and JavaScripts. It will also respond to requests for dynamically-generated HTML pages. Since our dynamic content will be generated by Go, it makes sense to name our app `go`.\n\n## Exercise goals\n\n [CHECKSUM: determine-which-eyebrow-dominant.-before]",
