What Is Caulk?\n\nThis section discusses why caulking is used in construction, as well as different types of caulk available for use.\nIt also covers common questions about caulking, including whether it's necessary or harmful, if it can be used outdoors,\nand what happens when it dries out.\n\n### 1.1. Types Of Caulk\n\nThere are several types of caulk that are suitable for various uses, such as sealing gaps between windows, doors, and\nwalls; filling cracks around pipes and wires; repairing leaking roofs; and more. Commonly used types include silicones,\npolyure",

The type you should use will depend on what it's going to be used for. For instance, some products are designed to be flexible, others rigid, and still more are waterproof.\n\n#### 1.1.1. Silicone\nSilicones are rubbery substances that can bend and flex without breaking. They're very effective at sealing around windows, doors, and sinks.
