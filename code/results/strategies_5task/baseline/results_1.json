  "message": "Cut the wires. Cut one plastic connector( plug) off of each wire, you should used dykes or wire cutters, but if you don \u2019 t have those a knife or scissors will do. It is important that you cut opposite sides off otherwise the you stand a 50/50 chance of screwing up step three. If you look at the connectors with the hook down you should see four wires in this order Black, Red, Green, Yellow from left to right and the other connector will have them in reverse order. Cut the connector with the wires in BRGY off the first wire then the connector with the YGRB off the second wire.",
